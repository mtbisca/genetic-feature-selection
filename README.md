# Genetic Feature selection
Brief experiments using genetic algorithms for feature selection for the regression task proposed by the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/communities+and+crime">Communities and Crime Dataset</a> from UCI Machine Learning, written in tutorial form. Please note that these experiments focus solely on the feature selection implementation.
